Science is everywhere and life with science is fun! Working with children, for children and around children is one of the most fun, difficult, entertaining and most rewarding things in the world.

Main Idea
We think that a science education will protect all children's well-being for today and for the future. When we say "science", we imagine a world full of children who feel excitement, who examine their surroundings with curiosity, and desire to discover the hidden world of science in life.

In general, concepts of hands-on and minds-on science are not different things. Because at schools, teachers are the guiders for these programs, but for "Science at Home" we can only reach the children via our videos. So this inhibits students being minds-on and being their own discoverers from an early age.
